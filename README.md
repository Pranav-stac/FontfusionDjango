Welcome to **Font Fusion**, a powerful font generation tool that uses cutting-edge AI models like **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** to combine two font styles into a completely new alphabet set! Not only does this project allow you to create new fonts from scratch, but it also comes with a feature-rich app where you can use the generated fonts in real-time for various creative purposes, including document editing, funky fonts, and even drawing letters to generate fonts!

## 🌟 Features

### ⚙️ AI-Driven Font Generation:
- **GAN & VAE Models** trained on font images.
- Combine two alphabet images and generate a new set of characters that share characteristics from both.
- Generate all letters of the alphabet based on the merged style.

### 📱 Mobile App: Go on 
- **Generate New Fonts**: Use the models to create custom fonts on the fly.
- **Real-Time Font Usage**: Apply newly generated fonts directly within the app for document creation.
- **Google Docs Alternative**: A full-featured editor within the app that allows text formatting using the custom fonts.
- **Draw to Generate Fonts**: Draw letters, and the model generates a matching font based on the drawing.
- **Funky Fonts**: Pre-built funky and artistic fonts for creative projects.
